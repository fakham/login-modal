# Login Modal

You can integrate this modal into your web page and you'll have a nice designed login modal.

## How to integrate

- copy css, fonts, img, js and vendor folders to your project.
- go to the web page you want to add the modal to and link your files you just copied (see [index.hmtl](https://github.com/fakham/login-modal/blob/master/index.html))
- don't forget to integrate this [login-modal-controller.js](https://github.com/fakham/login-modal/blob/master/js/login-modal-controller.js) so you can show and hide your modal using buttons.
